# AI/ML Image Classification using CNN (CIFAR-10 Dataset)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform supervised image classification on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The goal was to build, train, evaluate, and visualize the performance of a model that classifies images into one of ten predefined categories.
